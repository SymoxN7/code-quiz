## Description

This project is to demonstrate my use of JavaScript to create a JavaScript themed quiz, it will ask the user questions and provide 4 choices, on a wrong answer it till minus 15 second from the total timer, on a correct answer it will move to the next question. When all questions are answered, or if the time runs out, the quiz will end. The remaining time is the score presented at the end, this will be saved in a scoreboard.
